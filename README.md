# CJK-decomposition

The decomposer can be used to split Chinese, Japanese or Korean signs into smaller components.
This mapping from original character to smaller components we call "decomposition".
The goal is to have a decomposition of each sign into smaller components, whereas we only allow decompositions which are part of the actual unicode and are storeable by UTF-8 coding

As decomposition basis we use the 'ids.txt' which is a copy of https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids/blob/master/ids.txt.
